Our project aims to build a recommender system for Rent the Runway to better match customers with the most appropriate items. 
Specifically, we will first try to predict whether a user would rent an item. 
Moreover, we will predict the rating to present a ranked list of items given a specific user. 
And lastly, we will try to classify the item by the occasion customers rent those items for so that we can prompt filtered items to satisfy customers need.
